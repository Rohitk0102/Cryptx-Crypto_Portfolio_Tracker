## 3. UI/UX EXPECTATIONS

### Visual Aesthetics
- **Style**: Minimalist, clean, and "neat". Avoid cluttered backgrounds or messy geometric shapes.
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary**: White (`#FFFFFF`) / Slate-50 (`#F8FAFC`)
  - **Text**: Slate-900 (`#0F172A`) for high contrast and legibility.
  - **Accents**: Subtle professional Blue (`#2563EB`) or Slate-500 for secondary information.
- **Corners**: Modern rounded aesthetic (e.g., `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl` for cards).

### Typography & Readability
- **Font**: Use **Inter** or a similar high-quality sans-serif font stack.
- **Legibility**:
  - Body text must be **16px - 18px** for comfortable reading.
  - Never use "tiny" fonts (below 12px) for critical information.
  - Clear hierarchy: Bold section tags, authoritative section titles, and readable body paragraphs.

### Component Structure
1. **Navbar**: Fixed with backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-md`). Clean branding on the left, logical navigation links, and a prominent "Contact" CTA.
2. **Hero**: Breathable layout. Large bold heading, clear value proposition tagline, and direct action buttons (Primary & Secondary).
3. **About**: Outcome-oriented. Use a blend of concise text and visual domain cards. Include high-level statistics (e.g., student count, focus areas).
4. **Leadership**: Feature the current HOD prominently, while maintaining a neat listing for the history of departmental heads.
5. **Courses**: Tabbed interface to switch between UG, PG, and Research. Each course card should be clear and descriptive.
6. **Events**: Table-like or neat list format. Focus on technical depth and impact metrics.
7. **Footer**: Professional slate-themed footer with contact details, address map/info, and hierarchical navigation links.
